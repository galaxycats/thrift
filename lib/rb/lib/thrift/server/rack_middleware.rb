# A Rack application to be used within a Rails application to provide an API
# access via Thrift. You have to insert it into the MiddlewareStack of Rails
# within a custom initializer and not within the environment, because Thrift
# is not fully loaded at that point.
# 
# Here is a sample of to to use it:
# 
#     ActionController::Dispatcher.middleware.insert_before Rails::Rack::Metal, Thrift::RackMiddleware,
#                                                                               { :processor => YourCustomProcessor.new,
#                                                                                 :hook_path => "/the_path_to_receive_api_calls",
#                                                                                 :protocol_factory => Thrift::BinaryProtocolAcceleratedFactory.new }
# 
# Some benchmarking showed this is much slower then any Thrift solution without
# Rails, but it is still fast enough if you need to integrate your Rails app
# into a Thrift-based infrastructure.
